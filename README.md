#Deutsch_Verben

##### Philip Braunstein (pbraunstein12@gmail.com)

### Overview
These scripts allow a user to see the patterns in German verb formation. `getByFamily.py` explores families of verbs by their root verb. `dl.py` selects randomly from the database (`dl.csv`) and tests the user on the meaning and participle of the selected word.

### Background
German is a language that is extremely compassable. Words are formed by combining existing  words. *Gehen* means "go," and related words are created by prepending prefixes. *Aufgehen* (literally *upgo*) means "rise", *umgehen* (literally *aroundgo*) means "circumnavigate", etc.

### Data
The database is certainly incomplete. It was assembled by hand.

### Usage
Usage of `getByFamily` is documented in the `usage()` function of this script. Simply running `./dl.py` encompasses the full capability of this script.
